# Bulk_FIle-Cleaver
An extensive application to provide functionality of renaming files in bulk based on customized naming options (prefix, suffix, etc.). The system previews all changes before applying them. I am also working on a module to classify discovered files using a linear regression classifier and provide renaming suggestions.
